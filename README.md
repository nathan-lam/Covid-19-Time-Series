# Covid-19-Time-Series
Project from Stat 153: Time Series during Spring 2021  

This is the project I did in the class, to do a time series analysis of Covid-19 using the number of new cases.

Data was provided by the professor and presented under a fictional context.


# Report
Results of the time series analysis can be found as a report in **Project-stat-153.pdf**
